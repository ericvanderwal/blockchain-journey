# blockchain-journey
A path to blockchain developers education with a focus on Polkadot, Substrate &amp; Rust.
Simply put, this is my journey to a blockchain education as a developer who has no professional experience or education in blockchain previously.

One of the most difficult tasks I found to date, was often not understanding the content, but rather finding it. Blockchain spans a wide range of technologies from peer to peer networks to cryptography (not even considering the actual application of the blockchain itself). A fair amount of this education is either aimed at crypto traders or those with an extensive amount understanding of crypto development already. Neither of which may be of much help to new blockchain developers.

The following in my list of recommended free and paid educational resources which I found to be helpful. 

## A Few Notes

A few small notes for context. I have been a developer for 5+ years at this point, working mostly in languages that are compiled and type safe. In this list, I focused on Substrate, a framework for creating your own blockchain (and blockchain applications), which is the underlying technology created for Polkadot Coin. Substrate allows you to avoid having to re-invent to the wheel, especially as an individual developer or a small team.

Substrate is written in Rust, which is considered to have a fairly difficult learning curve at the beginning. Especially if you have never worked with a compiled and type safe language, such as C, C++, C#, Java, etc. Honestly, Rust is not recommended as a first programming language. If you are looking into your first programming language, I highly recommend C#, as it frankly has some of the best tooling around and can be used for web (asp.net), frontend (blazor), mobile applications, gaming (unity, mono), cross platform desktop applications (.net core 5+) and just about anything you can think of. C# has a long history and is well supported. Furthermore, it is a curly brace language {}, and from here, it will be easier to learn most other programming languages, including Rust.

# Resources for Learning Rust

## Online Courses / Videos

I watched most of these courses in paralell. I used Rust Fundamentals on Pluralsight as my topic guide. After finishing each topic/ section, I would watch the analegous section on the other courses (mostly). I find I better understand a topic after seeing more than one perspective on it. If you don't have access to the paid (free 1 month membership?) Pluralsight course, I would suggest instead starting with Rust Programming Tutorials (series) by Dcode as your main reference.

### Ultimate Rush Crash Course (Udemy) <- PAID
https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/

This is one of the most popular Rust courses on Udemy and it fills a specific niche. It does cover all of the fundamentals of Rust in a short period of time. It is clear and includes some good (and sometimes difficult) sample challenges to keep you sharp. I would note however, you still need to go outside of this course to look up specific topics in more depth. Various important topics are glossed over too fast. Its key selling point in my mind, is that is complete (covers each topic) and gives an excellent outline of things you should know to get started with Rust.

### Rust Fundamentals by Dmitri Nesteruk (Pluralsight) <- PAID
www.pluralsight.com

If you already have a Pluralsight subscription, this is a must watch. While it was recorded in 2015 it still retains its value as a fundamentals course for Rust. I found this course to be a little bit slower than the Udemy course, but that is not a bad thing. For a paid course, this IMHO is the best one I have taken. It would be great to see an updated version. Interestinly, this is the only Rust course on all of Pluralsight, which is a shame. If you can get a free trial month on Pluralsight, you can finish it in that amount of time.

### Rust Tutorial Series by Doug Milford (Youtube)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLqEtX6ql2EyPAZ1M2_C0GgVd4A-_L4_5

This is a really great series on Rust for beginners. Doug likes to compare it back to other programming languages, which is really nice. Be prepared for lots of dad jokes and other silly humor (which I think adds levity to an otherwise sometimes dry topic). Doug should probably be selling this course, because it is certainly worth the value. 

The pros are the videos get into more detail than the Rust Fundamental course on Pluralsight. The cons are, the videos get into more details than the Rust Fundamentals course. It also offers a little less structure, which is to be expected for youtube content.

### Rust Programming Tutorials (Series) by DCode (Youtube)
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVvjrrRCBy2JSHf9tGxGKJ-bYAN_uDCUL

Another solid series on youtube for free. This one compared to Doug Milfords is much more terse and to the point. It works great as a brief introduction to each topic or a refresher. Well worth the watch.


## Books

### The Rust Programming Language (Covers Rust 2018) <- Paid
https://www.amazon.com/Rust-Programming-Language-Covers-2018-ebook/dp/B07SRQ97RD/

Free version: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ <- Free Online Version

"The official book on the Rust programming language, written by the Rust development team at the Mozilla Foundation, fully updated for Rust 2018."

A good solid introduction to Rust from the Rust development team. It covers all of the major topics, but sometimes can be a bit light on the more advanced topics. As I mentioned above, no single source will teach you Rust and this book is no exception.

### Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Rust <- Paid
https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Data-Structures-Algorithms-Rust-ebook/dp/B07N7D6PG4/

An 'intermediate' level book on data structures with Rust. For me, this was a 2.5 - 3 stars out of 5. It has some good leads on working with data structures in Rust, however, if you are not already familar with the data structures, then this is probably not the right place to start. Overall, I was hoping it would be a little more clear.

### Programming Rust: Fast, Safe Systems Development <- Paid
https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Rust-Fast-Systems-Development-ebook/dp/B077NSY211

Another introductory book on the topic of Rust. Covers all basic topics that one should know in order to get started.

## Online

### Rust Website Documentation
https://www.rust-lang.org/learn

This will be key in learning Rust, as it contains all the official documentation. It is written quiet clearly, especially compared to some other languages documentation websites. This includes links to various online books for Rust as well. 

### Rust By Example Projects
https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/

As the title implies, this is a series of Rust by example lessons that you can follow along with. I highly recommend this one as you can only 'really' learn to do something by actually doing it. (Otherwise it is purely theortical).

### Rustlings Github
https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/

"Greetings and welcome to rustlings. This project contains small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code. This includes reading and responding to compiler messages!"

Want to get some more hands on code experience in Rust? This is another good place to do it (theorectically). I havent actually done this due to a lack of time. It is on my todo list however.

### A16Z Cryto Start Up School
https://a16z.com/crypto-startup-school/

After having a basic understanding of what blockchain is and crypto, this is a great (free) place to get a structured overview of crypto and blockchain technology, especially if you are interested from the business/ developer perspective.

The videos and files are avaliable on demand without any sign up and were recorded in 2020.
