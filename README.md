# blockchain-journey
A path to blockchain developers education with a focus on Polkadot, Substrate &amp; Rust.
Simply put, this is my journey to a blockchain education as a developer who has no professional experience or education in blockchain previously.

One of the most difficult tasks I found to date, was often not understanding the content, but rather finding it. Blockchain spans a wide range of technologies from peer to peer networks to cryptography (not even considering the actual application of the blockchain itself). A fair amount of this education is either aimed at crypto traders or those with an extensive amount understanding of crypto development already. Neither of which may be of much help to new blockchain developers.

The following in my list of recommended free and paid educational resources which I found to be helpful. 

## A Few Notes

A few small notes for context. I have been a developer for 5+ years at this point, working mostly in languages that are compiled and type safe. In this list, I focused on Substrate, a framework for creating your own blockchain (and blockchain applications), which is the underlying technology created for Polkadot Coin. Substrate allows you to avoid having to re-invent to the wheel, especially as an individual developer or a small team.

Substrate is written in Rust, which is considered to have a fairly difficult learning curve at the beginning. Especially if you have never worked with a compiled and type safe language, such as C, C++, C#, Java, etc. Honestly, Rust is not recommended as a first programming language. If you are looking into your first programming language, I highly recommend C#, as it frankly has some of the best tooling around and can be used for web (asp.net), frontend (blazor), mobile applications, gaming (unity, mono), cross platform desktop applications (.net core 5+) and just about anything you can think of. C# has a long history and is well supported. Furthermore, it is a curly brace language {}, and from here, it will be easier to learn most other programming languages, including Rust.

After having a basic understanding of what blockchain is and crypto, this is a great (free) place to get a structured overview of crypto and blockchain technology, especially if you are interested from the business/ developer perspective.
